# Prologue
This app is the Prologue, and you and your friends create the story. Enjoy!

## Roadmap
- **0.0.1-betaX** (Pre-release builds) - Starting February 21, 2026. Early experimental versions - the beta of the beta. These builds will contain bugs and unfinished features. Check the Releases page for the latest versions and help us improve by testing them and reporting issues via GitHub Issues.
- **0.0.1** (Public beta) - Estimated by March 1, 2026. The first public beta. If you’re looking for at least some stability, this is the version to start with. As it’s still beta software, you can expect some inconsistencies and imperfections, but reporting them via GitHub Issues will help us resolve any such problems quickly.
- **1.0.0** (Stable release) Estimated by April 1, 2026. Our official production ready launch! And no, this won't be april fools - your privacy and ownership over your data is serious stuff.
