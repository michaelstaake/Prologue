# Prologue
This app is the Prologue, and you and your friends create the story. Enjoy! Chat, voice call, video call, screenshare, and more. Always free and privacy first. Self-hosted on the web hosting provider or server of your choice.

## Roadmap
- **0.0.X** (Beta release) You can expect some inconsistencies and imperfections - please use GitHub Issues to report problems or suggest improvements.
- **1.0.0** (Stable release) Estimated by April 1st, 2026. And no, this won't be april fools - your privacy and ownership over your community is serious stuff.
- **Desktop client** (Planning stage) A lightweight desktop client seems to be very important to people, so I've gone ahead and started on that. Estimated release by May 1st, 2026.
- **Mobile app** (Please help) If anyone is experienced in this realm, please feel free to post in the forum (Discussions) with any ideas or input on this. Thank you!
